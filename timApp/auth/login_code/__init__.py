"""Module for managing simple login codes.

Login codes can be used to offer users a simplified login interface where the user may log in to TIM
by inputting a temporary login code instead of the usual user credentials.

.. note:: Login codes are intended as only a temporary login method! They should always have a limited
lifetime, and be purged once no longer needed.
